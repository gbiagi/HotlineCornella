As JAR filePermalink

The easiest way to deploy to Windows/Linux/Mac is to create a runnable JAR file. This can be done via the following
console command:
./gradlew lwjgl3:dist

If you are getting an error like Unsupported class file major version 60, your Java version (see here for a list) is
not supported by your Gradle version. To fix this, install an older JDK.

The generated JAR file will be located in the lwjgl3/build/libs/ folder.
It contains all necessary code as well as all your art assets from the android/assets folder and can be run either by double clicking
or on the command line via
java -jar jar-file-name.jar.
Your audience must have a JVM installed for this to work. The JAR will work on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X!
